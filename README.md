**FinReg-Validator** is an open-source Python library designed to assist financial institutions in automating data quality checks for **CCAR (Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review)** and **Basel III** regulatory submissions.

In the high-stakes environment of Tier-1 banking, data anomalies—such as null ISINs, future-dated trades, or negative notional values—can lead to failed Federal Stress Tests and significant regulatory fines. This tool acts as a **pre-submission firewall**, ensuring that trading datasets comply with standard Federal Reserve schemas before entering the reporting pipeline.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Regulatory Compliance Automation
* **CCAR Readiness:** Validates critical fields required for capital planning and stress testing models.
* **Basel III Alignment:** Enforces non-negative value logic for risk-weighted asset calculations.

### 2. Temporal Logic & TWD (Trade Working Day)
* **Future-Date Protection:** Automatically detects and rejects trades with timestamps beyond the current `datetime`, preventing "Future Dated" anomalies that trigger audit flags.
* **TWD Enforcement:** Ensures trade dates align with valid banking calendars.

### 3. Critical Identifier Validation
* **ISIN & CUSIP Integrity:** Scans millions of rows to ensure no financial instrument lacks a valid regulatory identifier.
* **Null-Value Quarantine:** Segregates records with missing `TradeID` or `NotionalAmount` for manual remediation.

## 🛠 Installation

You can clone this repository directly to integrate into your financial ETL pipeline:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/agattus/finreg-validator.git](https://github.com/agattus/finreg-validator.git)
cd finreg-validator
pip install pandas
```


## 💻 Usage Example

This library is designed to be dropped into existing Python-based Risk ETL workflows.

```python
from validator import FinRegValidator

# Initialize the validator with your raw trading data
v = FinRegValidator('daily_trades_batch_01.csv')

# Run the full suite of regulatory checks
report = v.check_integrity()

# Output the compliance report
print(report)

# Example Output:
# "RISK FAIL: Found 5 negative values in NotionalAmount."
# "COMPLIANCE FAIL: Found 12 trades with future dates."
```

## 📊 Business Use Case
The Problem
Financial institutions process millions of transactions daily. Legacy systems often allow "dirty data" (e.g., a trade date of 2099-01-01) to pass through to the reporting layer. When this data reaches the Federal Reserve or regulators, it causes:

Audit Failures (MRA/MRIA).

Capital Surcharges due to inability to calculate risk accurately.

Operational Waste (manual remediation by analysts).

The Solution
FinReg-Validator shifts data quality "left"—catching errors at the source (Ingestion) rather than the destination (Reporting). This reduces the risk of regulatory penalties and streamlines the CCAR submission lifecycle.
